# Project Feedback

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Exceeds Expectations**. 65 Commits! Excellent job getting a jumpstart on this project, and constantly challenging yourself to build upon your work, while also staying true to your original scope. Great readme! Thanks for sharing your process and thoughts, would definitely recommend this as a trend for all projects. As we move forward for larger projects, it would be nice to have more thoughts from your planning process, such as a Trello board, and relevant wireframes, I also encourage you to write out user stories for your backlog and ice box.

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Congratulations! Your project demonstrates dynamic use of the technologies and concepts we have covered so far! I really like how you mapped out the logic for your game early, and then built on it to handle the more complex problems such as how to deal with ties. Also, really enjoyed how you built a UI with player controls, as well as included card animations and sounds! Awesome!

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Nice and clean! Html is clearly structured and validated, CSS is not overly complex, and JS is object-oriented! Also, really liked the code comments! Moving forward, try to think about ways to make your code more modular, and ways to simplify where possible.

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Exceeds Expectations** Excellent work on this project!  Again, excellent comments in your readme! This will be useful to review as you go into Project 2 and/or an interview where they ask you to explain your code/process.
I'd encourage you to keep working on this as a side project and then publish it, even if just to `reddit.com/r/internetisbeautiful`.

Keep it up. You'll be hired in no time.
